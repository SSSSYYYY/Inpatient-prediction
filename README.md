# Inpatient-prediction
This is for the health care case comp

We Won the 1st place out of 100+ masters-level teams from 20+ universities in the U.S. and got $6000 as the price yaaaaay!

Objectiveï¼š  Given a population of Medicare Advantage members newly diagnosed with Type II diabetes in 2015, our team need to predict the patients most likely to have an admission and the ones to have a readmission to the inpatient setting in 2016.

Analytical road map:

(1) Data clean and manipulation
(2) Explortory analysis
(3) Feature engineering(900-->26)
(4) Model building (Logit(Boosted & Bagged/ Random Forest/ CART/ LDA))
(5) Iterate step 3 & 4 
(6) Model evalution
(7) Business outcome evauatoin
(8) Conclusion and recommedation

Outcome: Achieved model accuracy of 45% of an extremely imbalanced data(with logistic Boosted), increased bottom line result by 25%.
